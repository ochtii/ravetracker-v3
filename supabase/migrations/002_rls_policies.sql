/*
RAVETRACKER V3.0 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
========================================

1. ROLE HIERARCHY:
   - Anonymous: Can view public events and categories
   - Authenticated: Can view all published events, manage own profile/attendance
   - Organizer: Can create and manage events, view attendance for their events
   - Verified Organizer: Trusted organizers with enhanced privileges
   - Moderator: Can moderate content (approve images, etc.)
   - Admin: Full system access, can manage all resources
   - Super Admin: System administration (if needed)

2. ACCESS PATTERNS:
   
   PROFILES:
   - Own Profile: Full CRUD access
   - Public Profiles: Read access (unless private)
   - Organizer Profiles: Always public (for event information)
   - Admin: Full access to all profiles
   
   EVENTS:
   - Published Public: Read access for everyone
   - Published Private: Read access for attendees only
   - Draft Events: Access only for creator and admins
   - Event Creation: Verified organizers only
   - Event Management: Creator and admins only
   
   ATTENDANCE:
   - Own Records: Full CRUD access
   - Event Organizers: Read access to their event attendance
   - Admins: Full access
   
   NOTIFICATIONS:
   - Own Notifications: Full CRUD access
   - System/Organizers: Can create notifications
   - Admins: Full access
   
   IMAGES:
   - Public: View approved images for viewable events
   - Organizers: Full access to their event images
   - Moderators: Can approve/reject images
   - Admins: Full access

3. SECURITY FEATURES:
   - Row Level Security on all tables
   - Role-based access control with helper functions
   - Event privacy controls (public/private)
   - Organizer verification system
   - Content moderation for images
   - Audit logging capabilities
   - Permission testing functions

4. BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED:
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Defense in depth
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Security function isolation
   - Regular permission validation

5. MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE:
   - Security event logging
   - Permission testing utilities
   - Regular policy review mechanisms
   - Clear audit trails
   - Performance optimized queries

6. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Rate limiting for API calls
   - Geolocation-based restrictions
   - Time-based access controls
   - Enhanced audit logging
   - Automated security testing
