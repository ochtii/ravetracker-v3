# 🚨 RaveTracker v3.0 - Database Setup Required

## Current Status: ✅ Frontend Complete, ❌ Database Missing

Your RaveTracker v3.0 application has been fully developed with:
- ✅ Complete layout system with glassmorphism design
- ✅ User authentication with Supabase Auth
- ✅ Event management components
- ✅ Real-time notifications system
- ✅ Responsive mobile navigation
- ✅ Role-based access control

**However**, the Supabase database is missing the required tables, causing these errors:

```
relation "public.profiles" does not exist
Could not find a relationship between 'event_attendance' and 'events'
```

## 🛠️ Solution: Database Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `njovoopqcfywrlhhndlb`

### Step 2: Run Database Setup Script
1. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New query"**
3. Copy the entire contents of `database-setup.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see this message:
```
🎉 RaveTracker v3.0 Database Setup Complete!
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Application
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 📊 What Gets Created

The database setup script creates:

### Tables
- **profiles** - User profile information and settings
- **events** - Event details, location, pricing, lineup
- **event_attendance** - User event attendance tracking
- **event_categories** - Event types (Techno, House, Trance, etc.)
- **notifications** - User notification system

### Security & Performance
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for data protection
- **Foreign key relationships** for data integrity
- **Indexes** for optimal query performance
- **Triggers** for automatic timestamp updates
- **Sample data** for event categories

### User Roles & Permissions
- **User** - Basic event browsing and attendance
- **Organizer** - Can create and manage events
- **Admin** - Full system access and moderation

## 🎯 After Setup

Once the database is set up, your application will:

1. **Load without errors** - No more console errors
2. **User registration/login** - Full authentication flow
3. **Event creation** - Organizers can create events
4. **Event attendance** - Users can join/leave events
5. **Real-time updates** - Live notifications and updates
6. **Profile management** - User profiles with avatars
7. **Admin panel** - Admin users get management tools

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
auth.users (Supabase built-in)
    ↓ user_id
profiles (user profiles & roles)
    ↓ id (organizer_id)
events (event information)
    ↓ id (event_id)
event_attendance (attendance tracking)
notifications (user notifications)
```

### Fixed Query Issues
- Updated foreign key references to work without constraint names
